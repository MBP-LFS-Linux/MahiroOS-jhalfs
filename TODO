          ---------------


MASTER SCRIPT
-------------

  - For CLFS book sources http://svn.cross-lfs.org should be used.

  - Update README to reflect the new work-flow.


xLFS MODULES
------------

  - To create Makefile entries to build blfs-tool dependencies.
    Test LFS integration and port it to orher books.

  - To develop a new restart code.

  - To add support for copying to the final system pre-generated
    configuration files created by the user.


BLFS MODULE (See BLFS/TODO)
-----------


OTHERS
------

  - Add a Customization file discussing how to hack the generated scripts
    and Makefiles, using the Cracklib support for Shadow in LFS as an example.
    NOTE: that could require a special command line switch to regenerate the
    Makefile if additional scripts are manually added to the *-commands/*/ dirs.
