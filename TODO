            jhalfs TODO
          ---------------


MASTER SCRIPT
-------------

  - The BLFS moudule should can be called in conjunction with any of
    LFS, CLFS or HLFS modules.
    Before working on that we need to fix the BLFS support.

  - To create a script to install jhalfs system-wide. Work in progess.

  - To add support for build optimizations


LFS MODULE (all this is applicable also to CLFS and HLFS modules)
----------

  - To add a switch to build the BLFS module dependencies at the end of
    the LFS build, that is, wget and sudo. SVN and libxslt aren't needed
    at this stage due that the BLFS book could be downloaded and parser
    at the same time that the LFS book. Plus links or lynx to read the
    (to be) generated BLFS HTML pages and, maybe, gpm.
    Before working on that we need to fix the BLFS support.


BLFS MODULE
-----------

  - The SourceForge download links don't work.

  - The current code to use a FTP mirror as fallback is broken
    for several packages due FTP migration to upstream formats.

  - To fix files creation using sudo. Comment from Ag Hatzim:

      Commands, that using cat with sudo, to redirect the output to
      certain files that users have no write access, will fail.

      Eg. fcron.

      #-------------------------------#
      (~/jhablfs)sudo cat >> /etc/syslog.conf << "EOF"
      # Begin fcron addition to /etc/syslog.conf

      cron.* -/var/log/cron.log

      # End fcron addition
      EOF
      zsh: permission denied: /etc/syslog.conf
      #-------------------------------#

      Since the shell is doing the redirection (man bash -REDIRECTION),
      *before* the command is executed, sudo can not see the redirection,
      so a new shell is needed for sudo to execute the actual command.

      Like so, the previous command should be something like this.

      #-------------------------------#
      (~/jhablfs)sudo sh -c "cat >> /etc/syslog.conf << "EOF"
      # Begin fcron addition to /etc/syslog.conf

      cron.* -/var/log/cron.log

      # End fcron addition
      EOF"
      #-------------------------------#

  - Figure out how to handle Perl modules installation and other pages
    that have commands to install more that one package (e.g., Gnat in GCC
    Java-bin in Java, sane-backends and sane-frotnends in Sane, etc)

  - Figure out how to handle alternative dependencies. I.e.,
    XFRee86 versus Xorg.


OTHERS
------

  - Add a Cunstomization file discussing how to hack the generated scripts
    and Makefiles, using the Cracklib support for Shadow in LFS as an example.
    NOTE: that could require an special command line switch to regenerate the
    Makefile if additional scripts are manually added to the *-commands/*/ dirs.
