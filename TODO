            jhalfs TODO
          ---------------


MASTER SCRIPT
-------------

  - The BLFS module should be called in conjunction with any of
    LFS, CLFS or HLFS modules.
    Before working on that we need to fix the BLFS support.


LFS MODULE (Applicable also to CLFS and HLFS modules)
----------

  - To add a switch to build the BLFS module dependencies at the end of
    the LFS build, that is, wget and sudo. SVN and libxslt aren't needed
    at this stage due that the BLFS book could be downloaded and parser
    at the same time that the LFS book. Plus links or lynx to read the
    (to be) generated BLFS HTML pages and, maybe, gpm.
    Before working on that we need to fix the BLFS support.

  - To add support for copying to the final system pre-generated
    configuration files created by the user.


BLFS MODULE (See BLFS/TODO)
-----------


OTHERS
------

  - Add a Customization file discussing how to hack the generated scripts
    and Makefiles, using the Cracklib support for Shadow in LFS as an example.
    NOTE: that could require a special command line switch to regenerate the
    Makefile if additional scripts are manually added to the *-commands/*/ dirs.

  - To create a script to install jhalfs system-wide, if possible.
