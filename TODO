            jhalfs TODO
          ---------------


MASTER SCRIPT
-------------

  - Nothing to be done at code level, for now.

  - Update README to reflect the new work-flow.


xLFS MODULES
------------

  - Rework Makefile creation to build the system more "by the book".
    Work in progress

  - To create Makefile entries to build blfs-tool dependencies.
    Waiting the Makefile rework.

  - To add support for copying to the final system pre-generated
    configuration files created by the user.


BLFS MODULE (See BLFS/TODO)
-----------


OTHERS
------

  - Add a Customization file discussing how to hack the generated scripts
    and Makefiles, using the Cracklib support for Shadow in LFS as an example.
    NOTE: that could require a special command line switch to regenerate the
    Makefile if additional scripts are manually added to the *-commands/*/ dirs.

  - To create a script to install jhalfs system-wide, if possible.
