          ---------------
look at func_download_packages: use cat urls.lst |while read ...
instead of for line in $(cat urls.lst)

Remove PROGNAME. Use variables:
- REPO (full repo for git clone)
- COMMIT (anything that can be used with git checkout)
- BOOK for the book source directory. Either given or "book-source"
- COMMANDS for the commands directory.
