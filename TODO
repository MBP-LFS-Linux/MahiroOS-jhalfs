          ---------------


MASTER SCRIPT
-------------

  - Nothing for now.


xLFS MODULES
------------

  - Test current BLFS_TOOL Makefile integration in LFS and CLFS.
    Port it to CLFS-2 and HLFS, if possible.

  - To develop a new "restart" Makefile target code.

  - To add support for copying to the final system pre-generated
    configuration files created by the user, if that can be implemented.


BLFS MODULE (See BLFS/TODO)
-----------


OTHERS
------

  - Add a Customization file discussing how to hack the generated scripts
    and Makefiles, using the Cracklib support for Shadow in LFS as an example.

    NOTE:
      That requires a way to can regenerate the Makefile if additional
      scripts are manually added to the *-commands/*/ dirs.
