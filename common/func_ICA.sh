# Here are the ICA functions.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Here we prepare for the Iterative Comparison Analysis (ICA). Essentially, we
# copy most of our chroot phase files to a new location then perform some
# manipulations on the copied files to make diff comparisons easier. The steps
# involved are:-
#   (1) copy the whole tree (minus the PRUNEPATH defined below) to the CMP_DIR
#       location. Use tar as it seems like the most appropriate tool for copying
#       large directory trees around.
#   (2) delete all symlinks.
#   (3) gunzip all `*.gz' files.
#   (4) delete all hardlinked files (of course trying to leaving the "master"
#       intact)
#   (5) convert all `*.a' files (ar archives) into a directory of the same name
#       containing the unpacked object files.
#   (6) fully strip the whole lot (but being careful to strip only the debug
#       symbols from object `*.o' files).
