For now the code is able to do the first step for the new approach: to create
LFS-like books from BLFS sources, allowing to create linear build scrips and
Makefiles similars to the current ones for {C,H}LFS.

What remains to do:

1. - To make the top-level blfs script functional. That script should to create
       the working directory (selected at command line)
     a. Copy all BLFS/* files to it,
     b. Fetch the BLFS sources (output directory selected at command line or
          based on the book version),
     c. Run the packages.sh script.

2. - To develop the XSL code needed to create the build scripts.

3. - To develop the code to create the Makefile

4. - To find a way to track already installed packages by previous runs, to can
       skip them when creating the book/scripts/Makefile for a new target.
