For now the code is able to do the first step for the new approach: to create
LFS-like books from BLFS sources, allowing to create linear build scrips and
Makefiles similars to the current ones for {C,H}LFS.

What remains to do:

--   To review the XSL code needed to create the build scripts.
     A lot of book-versus-scripts and testing is needed.
     We need yet to figure out if we can to to handle Perl modules installation
     and other pages that have commands to install more that one package
     (e.g., Gnat in GCC Java-bin in Java, sane-backends and sane-frontends
     in Sane, etc) or not-estandart installations, like Xorg7

--   Test the method used to track already installed packages by previous runs.
     See if the packages version can be watched also.

--   Integrate the menuconfig based package selection, trying to make use of the
     installed packages traking system.

--   Bugs hunting.

--   Improve README.BLFS.

--   Develop a script to make cofee.
