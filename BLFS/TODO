For now the code is able to do the first step for the new approach: to create
LFS-like books from BLFS sources, allowing to create linear build scrips and
Makefiles similars to the current ones for {C,H}LFS.

What remains to do:

1. - To make the top-level blfs script functional. That script should to create
       the working directory (selected at command line)
     a. Copy all BLFS/* files to it,
     b. Fetch the BLFS sources (output directory selected at command line or
          based on the book version),
     c. Run the packages.sh script.

2. - To develop the XSL code needed to create the build scripts.
     Almost done. A lot of book-versus-scripts and testing is needed.
     We need yet to figure out how to handle Perl modules installation and
     other pages that have commands to install more that one package
     (e.g., Gnat in GCC Java-bin in Java, sane-backends and sane-frontends
     in Sane, etc)

3. - To develop the code to create the Makefile.
     Should be a separate script to be run manually after the user has
     review and edited the target build scripts.
     Must make the build scripts executables and set the SRC_ARCHIVE and
     FTP_SERVER envars.
     Work in progress.

4. - To find a way to track already installed packages by previous runs, to can
       skip them when creating the book/scripts/Makefile for a new target.
