##### GENERAL DESCRIPTION #####

This patch will enable the paco pacKAGE oRGANIZER to be used with jhalfs.
At the moment only the LFS and HLFS-glibc parts are supported.


##### QUICK START #####

1. Apply the paco.patch.
   (patch -Np0 -i contrib/jhalfs-paco.patch)

2. Edit the configuration files to your preferences.
   (common/config and LFS/config or HLFS/config)

3. Run the wanted script.
   (Only ./lfs or ./hlfs --model glibc if you want to use paco)

4. Run make.


##### PREREQUISITES #####

Before using jhalfs you should have some experience with LFS.

If you don't know what LFS is about, then head over to
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs and start from there.


##### NOTES #####

Paco-1.10.10 is currently recommended.
Remember to update the common/config file is using a newer version.
