 Hardened Linux From Scratch is a highly volatile project. Extreme design
 changes can occur and the build could be broken for extended periods of
 time, like right now.

 As of June.12.2007 jhalfs has been updated to match current HLFS SVN sources,
 included support to activate/deactivate additional build features.
