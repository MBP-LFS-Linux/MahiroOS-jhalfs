		::::NOTICE::::

 Hardened Linux From Scratch is a highly volatile project. Extreme design
 changes can occur and the build could be broken for extended periods of
 time.

 As of Sept.15.2006 jhalfs cannot build the svn book.  This is a book
 problem and not jhalfs.
 

 Automation failures:  
  1.Directory /dev and devices nodes /dev/null, /dev/console needed to be 
  created in kernfs
  3.Remove the creation of /null and /console node from the devices script.
