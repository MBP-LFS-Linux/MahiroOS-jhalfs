1. INTRODUCTION::

     This collection of scripts collectively know as jhalfs-X, strives 
  to create an accurate makefile directly from the xml files used to 
  generate a specific Linux From Scratch document.

     The usage of this script assumes you have read and are familiar with
  the book and therefore the configuration variables found in conf files
  will have meaning to you. There are a number of command line switches 
  which, if used, will override the config file settings.

  NOTES::
  *.  The resulting Makefile takes considerable time to run to completion,
  lay in a supply of caffeine beverages.

  *.  It is recommended that you temporarily unpack your linux kernel and
  run <make menuconfig> and configure the kernal as per the book and save
  the resulting .config file. This configuration rule also applies to uClibc
  when building a HLFS system using uClibc rather than glibc.
