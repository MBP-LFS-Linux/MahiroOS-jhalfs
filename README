jhalfs 0.2

The purpose of jhalfs is to provide a pure automated build of Linux From
Scratch. It does this by extracting the necessary commands and information
straight from the LFS book's XML source. It then creates a Makefile that
acts as the automation control of the commands to be run. Finally, if you have
specified it to do so, and have the necessary packages available (jhalfs can
download them if you need it to), it can begin and log the build process.

There are several options that jhalfs can employ, and that may be useful to
your particular needs. For a full list run:

jhalfs --help

Some variables of the build can be adjusted to fit your particular needs and
system. The file 'jhalfs.conf' can be used to specify certain variables of the
jhalfs build system. For more information, read the 'jhalfs.conf' file as it
should be self-explanatory.
