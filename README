1. INTRODUCTION::

     This collection of scripts, known as jhalfs-X, strives to create
  an accurate makefile directly from the XML files used to generate a
  specific book from the diferent Linux From Scratch documentation
  projects.

     The usage of this script assumes you have read and are familiar with
  the book and therefore the configuration variables found in conf files
  will have meaning to you. There are a number of command line switches
  which, if used, will override the config file settings.

  NOTES::
  *.  The resulting Makefile takes considerable time to run to completion,
  lay in a supply of caffeine beverages.

  *.  It is recommended that you temporarily unpack your linux kernel and
  run <make menuconfig> and configure the kernal as per the book and save
  the resulting .config file. This configuration rule also applies to the
  configuration of the uClibc package when building a HLFS system using
  uClibc rather than glibc.

2. INSTALLATION::
     No installation is required. No system-wide installation isn't allowed
  for now.

3. CONFIGURATION FILES::
     Each book in the LFS series has it's own set of configurable parameters as
  well as the common parameters file.
